## About
This a app for highlighting items within your stash that can be used to make the chaos recipe. 

## Download & Source
* Repo - https://github.com/CLOUGH/poe-recipe
* Download build - https://github.com/CLOUGH/poe-recipe/releases

## Rationale 
So over the weekend I worked on this app that highlights item in your stash to make the chaos recipe. I was trying to use https://github.com/kosace/EnhancePoEApp, it worked initially and then stopped. Tried reaching out to the dev but that was unsuccessful and I needed something to automate the process. Thus the reason for this app.

## Dev tools 
The app is built use Electron.js and Angular.  The base of the project was forked from https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron. 

## Expect Bugs
Note. This is a quick and dirty approach because I wasn't planning on developing the tool since one already exist and I was planning on using it but quickly realize that something was wrong. Imp saying that to say, expect bugs and issues until iron them out.  But for the most part it seem to work. I  literally spend maybe a couple hours building it because  I was trying to play the new season.

## What to Do if Your having Issues.
If you are experiencing issues just leave a comment in the project under issues. Sometime refreshing will work to solve the problem. You can do that by entering CTRL+R.  To completely clear what is being stored/hard reset everything press CTRL+SHIFT+R. Closing reopening the app can sometimes work.
Hope that helps
